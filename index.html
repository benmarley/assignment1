            <p>With 2011's <em>The Tree of Life</em>, Malick delivered a fascinating cinematic experience. Much of the film centers on a Texas family in the 1950s. In the film, <strong>Brad Pitt</strong> plays the father and Jessica Chastain plays the mother; their characters have very different ideologies, and their son, Jack, is caught between these clashing and contradictory philosophies.</p>
